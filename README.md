# Install-PDO_OCI-AND-OCI8-LINUX-UBUNTU-16.04
Installer PDO_COI and COI8 in Ubuntu 16.04 and PHP7.1. * For use of the Oracle 11g database (It may work for version 12c as well).

# **How to run Setup**

This *SCRIPT* (`install_pdo_oci.sh`) performs the compilation and installation of the *OCI8* and *PDO_OCI8* modules in *PHP7.1* running on the *Ubuntu 16.04* operating system. You can easily tailor the Script to your *LINUX* distribution by changing the *PATH* set from the *SCRIPT*.
To start the installation process, simply run *SCRIPT* and make sure that the installers for <u>php-7.1.8.tar.gz</u>, <u>instantclient-basic-linux.x64-11.2.0.4.0.zip</u> and <u>instantclient-sdk-linux .x64-11.2.0.3.0</u> (<!--These are the versions used by me-->) ***are in the same directory as the SCRIPT file*** (`install_pdo_oci.sh`). Do not worry about unpacking the files,*SCRIPT* will take care of this task.

Feel free to contribute to the development of this installer script.

Thank you.
